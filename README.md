# Truck Maintenance

Truck Maintenance is a project aimed at simplifying and automating the maintenance management process for truck fleets. It provides a centralized system to track and manage maintenance tasks, monitor vehicle health, and generate reports for efficient maintenance planning.

## Motivation

This project was born out of some specific requirements handed to me for a small trucking business. In an effort to modernize the API and simplify their infrastructure, I decided to rewrite it using newer technologies I needed to learn. 

I figured I could write it in a generic enough way to be open-source, and configure it during deployment. Hopefully this project can serve as a jumping off point for some other simple CRUD apis.

## Key Features

- TBD

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing truck and maintenance-related data.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB in Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development experience.
